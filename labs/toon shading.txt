HEADING MEDIUM: Pros of toon shading:
Renders super fast (< 1 min per frame generally)
Great control of colors in your scene.
Some people dig the style

HEADING MEDIUM: Cons of toon shading:
Takes a bit of setup even for basic features
High likelihood of an uncanny effect (See Uncanny 2D CG)
Particular to this lab: In this lab, toon shading is done with Arnold, the built-in renderer in Maya, not Renderman. If you want to combine toon shading and Renderman features, you may have to do some compositing in post.

HEADING MEDIUM: Pipeline
In this lab, toon shading is just using special shaders in Arnold, the built-in renderer in Maya. You can start toon shading as soon as you are done modeling your assets. You only need to unwrap UVs if you are attaching an image texture to the asset (see Attaching Image Textures/Shading the Pupils). Toon shading will require extra steps in rendering and compositing if you want to render image sequences with alpha channel (see Rendering Image Sequences).





HEADING LARGE: Getting Started
Download the toon shader lab here and set your project to it:
FILE: ToonShaderLab.zip

Open ToonShadingLab_Start.ma. You should see a sphere, a human, and a directional light.

HEADING LARGE: Set the Renderer to Arnold

The toon shaders we are using are part of Arnold, the default renderer that Maya comes with, so let’s set our current renderer to that. Open render settings by clicking on the icon with the clapboard and the gear.

HEADING LARGE: Basic Toon Shading
This lab will cover 3 main parts of toon shading: base colors, edges (the outline of color around objects), and rim light (the edge of light around objects)

Let’s attach a toon shader to the sphere. Hold down the right mouse button on the sphere and in the menu that appears, select Assign New Material.

Under the Arnold, Shader tab, select aiToon.

In the attribute editor for the sphere, you should see that an aiToon shader has been attached to the sphere.

HEADING MEDIUM: Base Colors
Find the Base section of the toon shader.

Set Color to any color you want. I’ll set mine to red.

This is what it looks like if you render the scene now.

The colors are incorrect and we want a sharper cutoff between the lights and darks of the sphere. To fix this, let’s add a ramp to the base color (This is easier to explain after it’s seen, so let’s set it up and explain later). Click the grid icon next to the Tonemap attribute.

Select Ramp

In the ramp, set interpolation to None (since we want no interpolation), and drag the white circle to the middle of the ramp

You should end up with a ramp that’s half black and half white.

Click on the black circle and set the Selected Color from black to a lighter grey.

If you render the scene now, it looks like this.

Explanation: What’s going on is that for the lighter parts of the sphere, the ramp’s white is mixed with the original red color (still the original red), and in the darker parts of the sphere, the ramp’s grey is mixed with the original red color (a darker red).

The x-axis of the ramp represents dark to light. You could actually add more than 2 colors to the ramp and get more complex shading. The color mixing method is equivalent to the “multiply” effect in Photoshop.

This is what happens when I change the grey to a light blue.

This is what happens when I change the grey to a light brown.
