HEADING MEDIUM: Pros of toon shading:
Renders super fast (< 1 min per frame generally)
Great control of colors in your scene.
Some people dig the style

HEADING MEDIUM: Cons of toon shading:
Takes a bit of setup even for basic features
High likelihood of an uncanny effect (See Uncanny 2D CG)
Particular to this lab:
In this lab, toon shading is done with Arnold, the built-in renderer in Maya, not Renderman. If you want to combine toon shading and Renderman features, you may have to do some compositing in post.

HEADING MEDIUM: Pipeline
In this lab, toon shading is just using special shaders in Arnold, the built-in renderer in Maya. You can start toon shading as soon as you are done modeling your assets. You only need to unwrap UVs if you are attaching an image texture to the asset (see Attaching Image Textures/Shading the Pupils). Toon shading will require extra steps in rendering and compositing if you want to render image sequences with alpha channel (see Rendering Image Sequences).





HEADING LARGE: Getting Started
Download the toon shader lab here and set your project to it:
FILE: ToonShaderLab.

Open ToonShadingLab_Start.ma. You should see a sphere, a human, and a directional light.

HEADING LARGE: Set the Renderer to Arnold

The toon shaders we are using are part of Arnold, the default renderer that Maya comes with, so letâ€™s set our current renderer to that. Open render settings by clicking on the icon with the clapboard and the gear.
