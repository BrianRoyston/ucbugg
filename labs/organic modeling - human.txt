HEADING LARGE: INTRODUCTION

Although modeling a human character might seem like a big challenge at first, it is an incredibly rewarding experience and essential knowledge to have as advanced 3D Modelers! In this lab, we will be breaking down the general workflow, important concepts, and useful tools that all go into organic modeling. 

Keep in mind that for this lab, we will be modeling a specific character we created (her name is April), but we ask that you follow this lab with your OWN character in mind. Most likely, this will be a character that you’ll be using in your short, but you are welcome to come up with another design if you’d like. (Original characters/concepts are preferred so that you are challenged to create a human model that does not already exist) 

The point of this lab is to teach you the general concepts and workflow of organic modeling, therefore don’t worry about following every single step EXACTLY as we do it. Rather, try to consider the logic of what we do, and apply a similar logic to your own characters to get the end result you want.


HEADING LARGE: GENERAL WORKFLOW

Before we go into the actual modeling, we want to review the general workflow or process that goes into modeling human characters.

There are many different workflows for creating human models, all of which are equally effective, but the workflow that we will be teaching looks something like this:

<b> CHARACTER DESIGN/CONCEPTS -> SCULPTING -> RETOPOLOGY -> ADDING DETAILS </b>

To explain in more detail: first we start with our character designs and sheets, next we create an initial sculpt of our character which serves as a base for our model, then we retopologize the model so that we make sure to maintain good edge flow and topology, and lastly, we insert the important details back into our model. 

There are many powerful programs that are made specifically for the sculpting phase of modeling and allow artists to create HIGHLY detailed sculpts. However, since we primarily use Maya in this class, we will be doing this entire process in Maya. If you are interested in seriously going into character modeling in the future, then we recommend that you look into programs like Zbrush or Mudbox for organic sculpting, however in this class, we’ve seen many students create impressive models entirely with Maya.

At this point, we already have our character designs ready so we are ready to go into the sculpting phase of modeling!


HEADING LARGE: SCULPTING

Once again, as we walk through these steps remember that you don’t have to follow exactly what I do; as long as you follow the general process you will be fine.

The first thing we need to do is properly set up our scene. I am going to create two image planes perpendicular to each other and import my character sheets in like so:

Sculpting/01_characterSheets_setup.png

Now that our scene is set up we are ready to begin sculpting. 

We are going to start with a basic sphere. Give yourself enough edge loops so that you have a decent amount of resolution to work with. 

Sculpting/02_simpleSphere.png

Once you have created your sphere, you want to make sure to scale it down to properly match your character sheets.

Sculpting/03_positionFRONT.png

Sculpting/04_positionSIDE.png 

If you haven’t already, at this point I would recommend turning on <b> X-Ray shading </b> to be able to see through your model. I would also recommend turning <b> Symmetry On<b>. This is very important to ensure that your model is SYMMETRICAL and maintains good topology on both sides.

Sculpting/05_xray.png

Sculpting/07_symmetryOn.png

Now, we are going to roughly shape our sphere into the head and neck of our human. You can do this however you like, but I find that the easiest way to do this is with the Sculpting tools. Here is a brief explanation of what the first four tools in the palette do.

image2.png

<b>SCULPT</b>
Pulls up on the surface, or pushes in when inverted. This is very useful for defining shape in your character. Make sure to adjust the Strength of this tool by double-clicking it to open up the tool options as the default strength for this tool tends to be too high for most models.

<b>SMOOTH</b>
Smooth will make the topology of your mesh spread out more evenly as you draw over vertices. You can access the Smooth tool while you are using any sculpting tool by holding down the Shift key.

<b>RELAX</b>
Relax is very similar to smooth, but it will attempt to retain the shape of your model while spreading out your vertices.

<b>GRAB</b>
Grab lets you move whatever vertices fall underneath your brush. If you use this tool with a big radius, you can adjust the size and proportions of your mesh quickly. This is the tool I recommend using to block out your shape later.

There are way more tools than just these 4, and I suggest you experiment with them, but these are the most important ones and are pretty much all you need to start making your character.

Now without caring about the current topology, I am going to push this sphere into a really really rough shape of the human head by using various sculpting tools. I want to emphasize that <b> you shouldn’t spend too long trying to get this perfect as this won’t be our final mesh.</b> Our sculpt will inevitably look weird and blobby and that is totally fine since we will only be using it as a reference in the future. This will make more sense once we reach the Retopology phase of modeling.

First, I’m going to use the grab tool to sculpt the sphere into the rough face shape of April. Remember to refer to your character sheets for this step!

Sculpting/08_basicShapeFRONT.png

Sculpting/09_basicShapeSIDE.png 

Next, we are going to sculpt a basic nose shape. For this, I used a combination of the grab tool as well as moving individual edges and vertices. 

Sculpting/10_sculptNose_a.png

Sculpting/12_sculptNose_c.png

Sculpting/13_sculptNose_d.png

Now we are going to include some really rough indents where the eyes should be. Once again, I used a combination of the sculpting tools and move tool with soft select on to push a very very basic eye socket shape into our sphere. Remember to refer back to your character sheets to get an idea of where you want to put the eye shape.

Sculpting/14_sculptEyes_a.png

Sculpting/15_sculptEyes_b.png

Finally, we want to sculpt a basic neck and chin shape for April. The easiest way to do that is to select the ring of faces on the bottom of the sphere and extrude them downwards

Sculpting/18_sculptNeck_b.png

Sculpting/19_sculptNeck_c.png

At this point, you might need to add in a few edge loops to be able to sculpt on the shape you just extruded down. 

Sculpting/20_sculptNeck_d.png

Now we can more easily sculpt this shape into a neck using the sculpting tools. This also creates a basic chin shape for April. 

Sculpting/21_sculptNeck_e.png

You want to make sure that you are switching between front and side view to ensure that your sculpt looks the way you want. 

Sculpting/23_sculptNeck_g.png 

After some tweaks here and there, this is what my rough sculpt of April looks like. REMEMBER THAT THIS SCULPT DOES NOT HAVE TO LOOK PERFECT so don’t spend too much time making it look pretty.

Sculpting/24_finalSculpt_FRONT.png

At this point, if you have not already, make sure that you rename your sculpt in your outliner.

HEADING LARGE: QUAD DRAW

Once you’ve shaped your sphere into a rather blobby looking human head shape, we are going to start building the actual mesh that you are going to use. The reason we need to do this is because the head blob that we just created doesn’t have anywhere near the correct edge flow that will allow us to easily animate it later. We are going to retopologize our mesh with the Quad Draw Tool. Quad Draw is a really cool feature that Maya has that lets you use another model as a reference for you to draw your topology on top of. This is a commonly used industry practice that allows artists to create their models without having to focus on the technical details of edge flow and topology until the end after all the creative parts are out of the way! 

image7.png

The first thing we need to do is make sure we let Maya know which file we are going to be using as our reference. Select your head blob and find the button at the top of the Maya tool shelf that looks like a Magnet that says “Make Live”. Push this button and it should switch from displaying “No Live Surface” to whatever the name of your mesh is.

Alright, now before we get excited and start dropping points anywhere, let’s take a look at what our topology should look like. Head over to this link and take a look at the picture of the flattened out face. Pay attention to where the thick black circles are. These are called 5-poles where 5 edges intersect. They are placed at specific points to allow for a wide range of movement at those points. This website also has really nice videos that explain more about the theory behind the topology.

http://hippydrome.com/MeshDesignFace.html

Ok, let’s start dropping our points onto the mesh. Select the Quad Draw tool from the Mesh Tools drop down. Now if you click anywhere on your mesh, you should see a couple of green dots appear (If only one dot appears, your symmetry got turned off. Go back into your selection tool and turn Symmetry back to Object-X)

We are going to start with the eyes. Make a ring of points around the indents where the eyes should go. There should be the same number of points on the top half as the bottom half (I used 5 points for the top eyelid, and 5 for the bottom eyelid).

Now we are going to repeat this process and create another ring of points around the ones you just made (Use the exact same number of points that you used in the previous step)

Now for some magic. Hold down the shift key and hover your mouse somewhere between 4 points. You should see a blue square appear. Click to place this quad between your 4 points and you should get something like this.

image8.png

image9.png

Keep shift-clicking between your dots until all of the dots are gone and we have a nice blue ring of quads where the eyes should be.

Now I’m going to add in the eyelids and bridge of the nose to connect the two rings. Copy the placement of my dots and fill them in with quads so you get something like this.

image10.png

If you feel like you need more edge loops to get something like this, fear not. Just hold down the Ctrl key and you should see green edge-loops appear when you hover over areas of your mesh. You can add in edge loops just with a couple of keypresses and a mouse click!

Now I’m going to add more quads to the nose area like so and also add some quads to the side of the eyes so it looks like he’s wearing goggles.

image11.png

Now from those quads that are sticking out from the eyes, let’s create a ring all the way around the head and connect them to each other at the back.

image12.png

Now that we have the base for our eyes and nose, let’s move on to creating the mouth and we will connect the pieces together later. Repeat the same process you used to create the eye rings but this time only create one ring around the mouth of your character. Just like you did for the eyes.

image13.png

Now we are going to connect our nose to our mouth. Add in these dots as shown here and complete the quad.

image14.png

Now let’s extend this to make a complete circle around the model’s chin.

image15.png

Continue with another ring

image16.png

Now I completely cover up the nose by adding quads down to the mouth.

image17.png

image18.png

Connect the mesh to the mouth. 

image19.png

image20.png

Note that I had to add some edge loops to the bottom lip to make it connect evenly. Let’s add in edge loops to the top lip so that the number of points on the top lip are equal to the number on the bottom.

image21.png

Now I’m going to fill in the mouth.

image22.png

Notice how similar this is to the eyes from the start!

Now I’m adding in quads that go around the eyes and that connect at the middle of the forehead.

image23.png

image24.png

image25.png

Now keep adding in more quads to bridge the gap between the eyes and the mouth.

image26.png

Keep filling in quads down the side of the face and connect them below the chin.

image27.png

image28.png

Add more quads down the side of the face. 

image29.png

image30.png

Start connecting it together at the back.

image31.png

Now fill in the top of the head and our head is complete! Notice I’ve also extended the loops all the way down along the neck as well.

image32.png

I’m going to close the holes for the eyes and mouth.

image33.png

Alright, we’re done with quad draw. Click on the magnet icon so that there is no longer a Live Object. Exit out of the Quad Draw tool and hide the mesh that you sculpted. This should leave you only with the mesh you drew with Quad Draw.

HEADING LARGE: CREATING THE BODY

Grab the bottom edge of your mesh and extrude down a few times to create the upper torso.

image34.png

image35.png

image36.png

Now grab faces where your character’s shoulders should be and extrude out. Notice that symmetry is still on (turn it on if it somehow got turned off).

image37.png

Add in an edgeloop here.

image38.png

image39.png

Grab these faces (I had to move my edgeloop in towards the neck before I grabbed these) and extrude down.

image40.png

image41.png

I’ve moved the faces out so that they are at an angle to the body and then I’ve extruded one more time. I scaled the face a bit to get it to be closer to an arm shape. I’ve also gone and adjusted some of my verts so that his shoulders and chest are slightly bigger.

image42.png

I’ve extruded the torso a bit more to be at about the same height as the wrists.

image43.png

image44.png

Adding in more edge loops to the front of the torso and to the arms.

I’m going to keep adjusting some verts. Let’s leave off modeling the hands for later. Let’s give him some legs to stand on now. 

image45.png

Use the Append to Poly tool to fill in the hole beneath him.

image46.png

Now use the Multi-Cut Tool to connect everything together. (Maya crashed here and I lost a ton of work so I had to redo a bunch of stuff so my model is slightly differently shaped but we’re going to ignore that).

image47.png

Grab faces along the bottom of the mesh like this and then extrude down.

image48.png

Add a bunch of edgeloops evenly spaced along the length of the legs. I would do some sculpting with the Grab tool again to make the legs less stick-like.

image49.png

You should get something like this.

image50.png

Grab those Faces where his feet should be and extrude out!

image51.png

I added some edgeloops to the feet and adjusted verts.

You’re probably going to have to move a bunch of vertices around on your model. At this point, your model should have everything modeled except the hands. I would take this time to shape your model to match your Character Sheets as closely as possible. Add in edgeloops as needed to get more detail. Since I’m not using a character sheet I’m just going to adjust my model’s body a bit.

image52.png

image53.png

Now for the hands I’ll be grabbing faces like these, and extruding 4 fingers.

image54.png

image55.png

image56.png

image57.png

image58.png

image59.png

Now for the thumb, select faces here and extrude twice. Now that you have the fingers blocked out, go back and add in edgeloops along the length of all of your fingers.

image60.png

With some minimal adjustment of verts, we have a hand!

Now let’s finish off some details in the face.

image61.png

Extrude the mouth in a couple of times to get a nice cavity.

image62.png

Grab these faces and extrude in to get your nostrils.


image63.png

Finally, extrude the eyes for some eye sockets.
 
image64.png

image65.png

Alright you now have a water-tight base mesh for your human character. Now, your character is probably pretty misshapen right now (so is mine), but you now have the proper topology to sculpt your character. You can now use your sculpt tools on your mesh to push stuff around until it fits your character sheets.

image66.png

With a ton of sculpting your model can end up looking like this! Please note the topology on the model: keep in mind that you should have at least 3 edge loops at the joint area, and less concentrated edge loops where there are no joints. This is <b>SUPER</b> important for rigging and skinning, where one edge loop should NOT dictate your rig.

Please submit a less rough version of your model to the homework form. We will NOT accept any misshapen human models, so please be sure to look up anatomy references or use your own character sheets as guides!
