HEADING LARGE: INTRODUCTION

Although modeling a human character might seem like a big challenge at first, it is an incredibly rewarding experience and essential knowledge to have as advanced 3D Modelers! In this lab, we will be breaking down the general workflow, important concepts, and useful tools that all go into organic modeling. 

Keep in mind that for this lab, we will be modeling a specific character we created (her name is April), but we ask that you follow this lab with your OWN character in mind. Most likely, this will be a character that you’ll be using in your short, but you are welcome to come up with another design if you’d like. (Original characters/concepts are preferred so that you are challenged to create a human model that does not already exist) 

The point of this lab is to teach you the general concepts and workflow of organic modeling, therefore don’t worry about following every single step EXACTLY as we do it. Rather, try to consider the logic of what we do, and apply a similar logic to your own characters to get the end result you want.


HEADING LARGE: GENERAL WORKFLOW

Before we go into the actual modeling, we want to review the general workflow or process that goes into modeling human characters.

There are many different workflows for creating human models, all of which are equally effective, but the workflow that we will be teaching looks something like this:

<b> CHARACTER DESIGN/CONCEPTS -> SCULPTING -> RETOPOLOGY -> ADDING DETAILS </b>

To explain in more detail: first we start with our character designs and sheets, next we create an initial sculpt of our character which serves as a base for our model, then we retopologize the model so that we make sure to maintain good edge flow and topology, and lastly, we insert the important details back into our model. 

There are many powerful programs that are made specifically for the sculpting phase of modeling and allow artists to create HIGHLY detailed sculpts. However, since we primarily use Maya in this class, we will be doing this entire process in Maya. If you are interested in seriously going into character modeling in the future, then we recommend that you look into programs like Zbrush or Mudbox for organic sculpting, however in this class, we’ve seen many students create impressive models entirely with Maya.

At this point, we already have our character designs ready so we are ready to go into the sculpting phase of modeling!


HEADING LARGE: SCULPTING

Once again, as we walk through these steps remember that you don’t have to follow exactly what I do; as long as you follow the general process you will be fine.

The first thing we need to do is properly set up our scene. I am going to create two image planes perpendicular to each other and import my character sheets in like so:

Sculpting/01_characterSheets_setup.png

Now that our scene is set up we are ready to begin sculpting. 

We are going to start with a basic sphere. Give yourself enough edge loops so that you have a decent amount of resolution to work with. 

Sculpting/02_simpleSphere.png

Once you have created your sphere, you want to make sure to scale it down to properly match your character sheets.

Sculpting/03_positionFRONT.png

Sculpting/04_positionSIDE.png 

If you haven’t already, at this point I would recommend turning on <b> X-Ray shading </b> to be able to see through your model. I would also recommend turning <b> Symmetry On</b>. This is very important to ensure that your model is SYMMETRICAL and maintains good topology on both sides.

Sculpting/05_xray.png

Sculpting/07_symmetryOn.png

Now, we are going to roughly shape our sphere into the head and neck of our human. You can do this however you like, but I find that the easiest way to do this is with the Sculpting tools. Here is a brief explanation of what the first four tools in the palette do.

image2.png

<b>SCULPT</b>
Pulls up on the surface, or pushes in when inverted. This is very useful for defining shape in your character. Make sure to adjust the Strength of this tool by double-clicking it to open up the tool options as the default strength for this tool tends to be too high for most models.

<b>SMOOTH</b>
Smooth will make the topology of your mesh spread out more evenly as you draw over vertices. You can access the Smooth tool while you are using any sculpting tool by holding down the Shift key.

<b>RELAX</b>
Relax is very similar to smooth, but it will attempt to retain the shape of your model while spreading out your vertices.

<b>GRAB</b>
Grab lets you move whatever vertices fall underneath your brush. If you use this tool with a big radius, you can adjust the size and proportions of your mesh quickly. This is the tool I recommend using to block out your shape later.

There are way more tools than just these 4, and I suggest you experiment with them, but these are the most important ones and are pretty much all you need to start making your character.

Now without caring about the current topology, I am going to push this sphere into a really really rough shape of the human head by using various sculpting tools. I want to emphasize that <b> you shouldn’t spend too long trying to get this perfect as this won’t be our final mesh.</b> Our sculpt will inevitably look weird and blobby and that is totally fine since we will only be using it as a reference in the future. This will make more sense once we reach the Retopology phase of modeling.

First, I’m going to use the grab tool to sculpt the sphere into the rough face shape of April. Remember to refer to your character sheets for this step!

If your grab tool radius is too large remember that you can change it by double-clicking on the tool icon and adjusting the size parameter. You can also hold down b and left-click and drag to adjust the brush size. 

Sculpting/08_basicShapeFRONT.png

Sculpting/09_basicShapeSIDE.png 

Next, we are going to sculpt a basic nose shape. For this, I used a combination of the grab tool as well as moving individual edges and vertices. 

Sculpting/12_sculptNose_c.png

Sculpting/13_sculptNose_d.png

Now we are going to include some really rough indents where the eyes should be. Once again, I used a combination of the sculpting tools and move tool with soft select on to push a very very basic eye socket shape into our sphere. Remember to refer back to your character sheets to get an idea of where you want to put the eye shape.

Sculpting/14_sculptEyes_a.png

Sculpting/15_sculptEyes_b.png

Finally, we want to sculpt a basic neck and chin shape for April. The easiest way to do that is to select the ring of faces on the bottom of the sphere and extrude them downwards

Sculpting/18_sculptNeck_b.png

Sculpting/19_sculptNeck_c.png

At this point, you might need to add in a few edge loops to be able to sculpt on the shape you just extruded down. 

Sculpting/20_sculptNeck_d.png

Now we can more easily sculpt this shape into a neck using the sculpting tools. This also creates a basic chin shape for April. 

Sculpting/21_sculptNeck_e.png

You want to make sure that you are switching between front and side view to ensure that your sculpt looks the way you want. 

Sculpting/23_sculptNeck_g.png 

After some tweaks here and there, this is what my rough sculpt of April looks like. REMEMBER THAT THIS SCULPT DOES NOT HAVE TO LOOK PERFECT so don’t spend too much time making it look pretty.

Sculpting/24_finalSculpt_FRONT.png

At this point, if you have not already, make sure that you rename your sculpt in your outliner.

Sculpting/26_renameOutliner.png

HEADING LARGE: QUAD DRAW

At this point, we’ve completed the Sculpting stage of the modeling process, and now we’re going to move onto the <b>Retopology Phase.</b>

Notice that the topology of our sculpted mesh is quite bad; if we actually tried to use this mesh for rigging or animation it would be a disaster. The way to fix this is to RETOPOLOGIZE our model, or essentially, create a new mesh with clean topology around the sculpt we just made. 

There are a few goals to keep in mind when we retopologize a model: one, is to ensure that our model has <b>GOOD TOPOLOGY</b>, two is to ensure that the topology of our model is <b>SYMMETRICAL</b>, and three, is to ensure that our model not only has good edge flow, but that it has a <b> SPECIFIC EDGE FLOW </b> that makes rigging and animating much easier.

In the example image below, we can see that the retopologized version of this model has specific rings of edges in various regions of the face (i.e. the ring of edges around her eyes or her mouth). This is the specific kind of edge flow that we want our model to have and thankfully, retopologizing our model allows us to do that.

Retopology/retopology.png

Don’t worry if these regions of edges feel confusing right now, we will go over the important ones as we retopologize our model.

To get a more thorough explanation of good edge flow and the theory behind good topology, feel free to check out the website linked below.

<a>http://hippydrome.com/MeshDesignFace.html</a>

Let’s get started!

We are mainly going to use a tool called <b>Quad Draw</b> that is super helpful to ensure that our human character has the proper topology and edge flow for animation.

Quad Draw is a really cool feature in Maya that lets you use another model as a reference to draw your new topology on. This is a commonly used industry practice that allows artists to create their models without having to focus on the technical details of edge flow and topology until the end after all the creative parts are out of the way! 


The first thing we need to do is make sure we let Maya know which mesh we are going to be using as our reference. Select your head sculpt and find the button at the top of the Maya tool shelf that looks like a Magnet that says “Make Live”. Push this button and it should switch from displaying “No Live Surface” to the name of your mesh.

image7.png

Sculpting/27_liveSurface.png

Now, to access the Quad Draw tool, go to <b> Mesh Tools -> Quad Draw </b>.

Sculpting/28_quadDraw.png

Ok, let’s start by dropping some initial points onto the mesh. With Quad Draw on, if you click anywhere on your mesh, you should see a couple of green dots appear. Remember that your symmetry should be ON at this point so any point you create on one side should appear on the other (unless you create a point in the center of the mesh).

We are going to start at the base of the forehead (right above the nose bridge area). Make a series of points in this area (I made 6 points in my model).

Retopology/01_points.png

Now for some magic. Hold down the <b>shift key</b> and hover your mouse somewhere between the points you made. You should see a blue square appear. Left-click while holding shift to place this quad between your points and you should get something like this.

Retopology/02_hover.png

Retopology/03_square.png

We’ve just created a quad for what will become our brand new, clean mesh of our character. However, as you can imagine, it might become too tedious to have to create a bunch of points and shift/click a many MANY times to create an entire character. Thankfully, Quad Draw has a few incredible shortcuts that will make our lives so much easier.

If you hold down <b>TAB</b> while you hover over an edge of the quad you just made, you should see it highlight green like this:

Retopology/04_tab.png

Simply, left-click and drag out that highlighted edge while holding down TAB, and a brand new set of faces will extend down from the existing one. 

Retopology/05_newSquare.png

Isn’t that amazing!!? This shortcut will definitely save you LOTS of time so make sure to use it often throughout this lab. (I did not know about this shortcut when I first used Quad Draw and my life was forever changed when I discovered it)

I’m going to use our amazing shortcut to extend a few more squares down the nose bridge and forehead area.

Retopology/06_moreSquares.png

Continue creating more quads until you have a ring of faces going around the eye-to-nose region of the face. It should look something like an eye mask at this point. 

Retopology/07_moreSquares2.png

Retopology/08_eyeMask.png

Notice that we have already successfully created the ring of edges that go around the outer eye socket area that appeared in the example image at the top of this section. This is just one of the important regions of the face that we need to consider, but thanks to Quad Draw, we’ve easily ensured that our model has the proper ring of edges in this area.

Right now, since I created my quads somewhat quickly, the vertices and edges of my quads are a bit crooked. This is also something that can be easily fixed, simply hover over an edge or vertex and drag it to adjust it’s position.

There are two tips to keep in mind as we create our quads: 

1) create quads that are evenly spaced and sized

2) make your quads LARGER rather than smaller

You can imagine that it would be super annoying to fill up an entire face mesh of quads if you create tiny squares compared to larger squares, so always start big and only add more edges/faces/vertices as you see fit.

After some minor adjustments my eye mask looks something like this:

Retopology/10_adjustedEyeMask.png

Moving on, we are now going to fill in the area of the eye sockets with more quads. The number of faces you have might be different from mine but that is okay as long as you are able to create the smaller ring of faces inside the larger eye mask area you created from before.

Retopology/11_smallerRing.png

Retopology/11_smallerRing_highlighted.png

In my case, I had to add an extra edge in the nose bridge area to make it easier to fill in the eye socket. A handy shortcut for that while remaining in Quad Draw is to hold down <b>CTRL</b>; a green line should now appear when you hover over the mesh. Simple left-click while holding down control to add the edge in.

Now fill in the last portion of the eye socket area with more quads. It should look something like this:

Retopology/12_filledSocket.png

Again, don’t worry if your mesh doesn’t look EXACTLY like mine; as long as you are maintaining the same kind of edge flow in your model you will be fine. Before we move on, this is a good time to check that the edge flow of the eye area is the way we want it. I find the easiest way to check my edge flow is to use the Ctrl hotkey to add edges and hover over my mesh; if the edge flow looks as expected then you should be good to go.

At this point, the important areas of edge flow on our model should look something like this:

Retopology/13_edgeFlow_highlights.png

Now that you’ve checked the edge flow of the eye region, we can continue with our retopology. Go to the quads on the side of the eye mask area and extend them further towards the side of the head to look like this:

Retopology/14_side.png

Retopology/15_extended.png
Continue extending the quads on the side of the mesh until you create a full ring of faces that connects to the back of the head.

Retopology/16_moreExtended.png

Retopology/17_connected.png

Now, I am going to go back to the tip of the quads at April’s forehead, and I am going to extend those quads all the way around the head to the back of the neck.

Retopology/18_extendUp.png

Retopology/19_extendUp2.png

Retopology/20_closedLoop.png

Now we are going to continue filling in rings of quads that start from the tip of the forehead and go all the way to the back of the head.

Retopology/21_moreRings.png

Retopology/22_moreRings2.png

Retopology/24_moreRings3.png

After repeating this process a few times, your model should look something like this:

Retopology/27_manyRings.png

The top of my mesh currently has a gap in it like this:

Retopology/29_topView.png

There are many ways one could approach filling in this gap but for me this is what made the most sense, while maintaining good edge flow. First, I connect the quads on the top of the gap to the bottom of the gap (I had to add one or two edges to make sure that the number of vertices lined up exactly).

Retopology/30_connecting.png

Retopology/31_connecting2.png

Next, I added some edges horizontally so that I could easily attach the middle section to the side vertices. In Quad Draw, you can easily merge two vertices by simply drawing one vertex into the other and they should automatically “stick” together.

Retopology/32_lines.png

Retopology/33_connect.png

The top of the head should be filled in now, however in my case, since the placement of the edges were quite close together, some of my faces are no longer evenly spaced. Once again, Quad Draw has a helpful solution for this: by holding down <b>SHIFT</b> and left-clicking and dragging across the mesh, you can smooth out or “relax” the vertices of your mesh. This is an easy and quick way to evenly space out our faces and to get rid of any crooked lines.

Retopology/34_smoothed.png

With this, we are done retopologizing the top half of our character.

Retopology/35_topHalf.png

Now I am going to start on the bottom half of the face. I’m going to extend the quads on the nose bridge further down to create the full nose. 

Retopology/36_noseExtend.png

Retopology/37_noseExtend2.png

Now that we have the nose area filled in, let’s move a bit further down and start working on the mouth. For this, we are going to repeat a similar process that we followed for the eyes/eye sockets. First, let’s create a ring of quads roughly around the mouth region. 

Start by placing your initial points first and creating your first few quads.

Retopology/38_placePoints.png

Retopology/39_placeQuads.png

Then, extend those quads out and downward to create a ring of faces around the mouth.

Retopology/40_mouthRing.png

Retopology/41_mouthRing2.png

We are now going to fill in the mouth area we just created with more quads. This process is almost identical to what we did earlier to fill in the eyes.

Retopology/43_mouthFilled.png


Now we are going to connect the nose and mouth area; in my case, I had to add some edges in the nose to make sure the mouth and nose could be connected.

Retopology/45_connectNoseMouth.png

Now I’m going to build some quads on the side of the mouth so that we can eventually create a ring of faces going all the way back to the head. 

Retopology/46_extendMouth.png

I’m also going to further connect the mouth to the nose so that we can start to develop the cheek area. 

Retopology/48_startCheek.png

Retopology/49_extendCheek.png

At this point, we are going to do a similar process that we did earlier in the top half of the head by creating an entire ring of quads that go from the side of the mouth and connect to the back of the head. I didn’t include many pictures of this since this process is identical to what we’ve done before, but at the end of this step my mesh looks something like this:

Retopology/55_almostDone.png

Now we want to start working on the chin and connecting it to the rest of the face. For me, this was easiest to do by first creating points towards the underside of the chin and connecting them to the sides of the face. It might look something like a strap under the chin.

Retopology/57_chinBeginning.png

Retopology/58_chinStrap.png

We can now connect this strap to the rest of the face.

Retopology/59_chinConnect.png

At this point, we can start filling in the gaps between the face and the chin.
Retopology/60_fillGap.png

Retopology/61_fillGap.png

Now, we can simply extend more quads into the neck region and connect these rings to the back of the mesh.

Retopology/62_neck.png

Retopology/63_neck.png

Retopology/65_neckComplete.png

And with that, we should have a completed retopologized face mesh with good edge flow! 

Retopology/66_finishedQuadDraw.png

Our mesh should be completely symmetrical as well. If you see that your mesh is for some reason not symmetrical, you can delete one half of the mesh and mirror the other side to ensure symmetry. 

At this point, I would take the time to also smooth out or “relax” your mesh to make sure that your quads are more evenly spaced out. If you turn on soft select while holding shift, you can smooth out your mesh even faster!

Retopology/67_softSelect.png

After all of these steps, your final mesh should have topology that looks somewhat similar to this, HOWEVER, do not be worried if your model is not exactly the same as mine. Remember that the point of this lab is not to recreate the character I’m making but rather to apply this workflow to create the character you need.

Retopology/68_retopo.png

HEADING LARGE: ADDING IN DETAILS

After all of these steps we do have a mesh with the topology that we want, however the actual mesh itself might not look like what we want. At this point, my mesh looks a lot closer to a weird blob than it looks like April.

Details/1.png

That is why we are going to spend some time adding the details that we want for our characters. A majority of this happens with the use of extrusions and the sculpting tools so this shouldn’t be anything new. However keep in mind that at this point, individual artistic preference will be the strongest factor of what you do. Therefore the steps that I wrote and the images I included are more vague than what I included for the previous section, and you might find that you’ll be doing different steps than me to get the character that you want (which is perfectly fine!)

The first detail I’m going to add is the ears: I’m going to select faces on the side of the head and extrude them outward. 

Details/2.png

Then I’m going to extrude in a few times to get the indent of the ear. Once again, feel free to do something similar or different than me.

Details/3.png

Next, I’m going to extrude near the ear region to actually get the eye socket indent. Select the ring of faces in the eye area and extrude inwards a few times. I also scaled and moved these faces a bit to get the exact eye shape that I wanted.

Details/4.png

Details/5.png

Now, I’m going to use soft select and the move tool to bring out the upper and lower eyelid area. This adds a bit of detail to April’s eyes and will make eye blendshapes easier in the future stages of the pipeline.

Details/6.png

My mesh looks something like this at this point.

Details/7.png

Now, I am going to repeat that same process for April’s mouth. Simply select the ring of faces in the mouth area and extrude them inwards.

Details/8.png

Details/9.png

One technical thing that is important to remember is to extrude the mouth area far back into the skull of the character. The reason for this is that if your character were to have more complex mouth blendshapes for emoting or even speaking, it’s necessary to have a deeper indent in the mouth. This is called the “mouth bag” of the character (an unfortunate name I know), and it’s an important detail to remember when making human characters.

Details/10.png

Next, I am going to use the move tool to adjust the vertices around April’s mouth so that I can give them some more detail and don’t look as flat.

Details/11.png

This took me some time to get a result that I was happy with but after some adjustments my model looks like this:


Details/12.png

Finally, I am going to work on the nose: at the moment, it is a bit flat and undetailed so I’m going to start by adjusting the vertices in that area to better emphasize the nose bridge.

Details/13.png

Details/14.png

After some adjusting, April’s nose looks something like this:

Details/15.png

Now, I’m going to extrude some of the faces inwards so that we can get the nostril’s shape.

Details/16.png

Details/17.png

At this point, I spent some time sculpting and adjusting my model to look more like April and get a result that I was happy with. I probably spent more time than is advised for the lab since you have more work ahead of you, however, it is up to you at this point, how much more work you want to put into getting the details of the face right. For now, we can move onto the next section of the lab which is creating the body of the mesh.

Details/18.png


HEADING LARGE: CREATING THE BODY

Grab the bottom edge of your mesh and extrude down a few times to create the upper torso.

image34.png

image35.png

image36.png

Now grab faces where your character’s shoulders should be and extrude out. Notice that symmetry is still on (turn it on if it somehow got turned off).

image37.png

Add in an edgeloop here.

image38.png

image39.png

Grab these faces (I had to move my edgeloop in towards the neck before I grabbed these) and extrude down.

image40.png

image41.png

I’ve moved the faces out so that they are at an angle to the body and then I’ve extruded one more time. I scaled the face a bit to get it to be closer to an arm shape. I’ve also gone and adjusted some of my verts so that his shoulders and chest are slightly bigger.

image42.png

I’ve extruded the torso a bit more to be at about the same height as the wrists.

image43.png

image44.png

Adding in more edge loops to the front of the torso and to the arms.

I’m going to keep adjusting some verts. Let’s leave off modeling the hands for later. Let’s give him some legs to stand on now. 

image45.png

Use the Append to Poly tool to fill in the hole beneath him.

image46.png

Now use the Multi-Cut Tool to connect everything together. (Maya crashed here and I lost a ton of work so I had to redo a bunch of stuff so my model is slightly differently shaped but we’re going to ignore that).

image47.png

Grab faces along the bottom of the mesh like this and then extrude down.

image48.png

Add a bunch of edgeloops evenly spaced along the length of the legs. I would do some sculpting with the Grab tool again to make the legs less stick-like.

image49.png

You should get something like this.

image50.png

Grab those Faces where his feet should be and extrude out!

image51.png

I added some edgeloops to the feet and adjusted verts.

You’re probably going to have to move a bunch of vertices around on your model. At this point, your model should have everything modeled except the hands. I would take this time to shape your model to match your Character Sheets as closely as possible. Add in edgeloops as needed to get more detail. Since I’m not using a character sheet I’m just going to adjust my model’s body a bit.

image52.png

image53.png

Now for the hands I’ll be grabbing faces like these, and extruding 4 fingers.

image54.png

image55.png

image56.png

image57.png

image58.png

image59.png

Now for the thumb, select faces here and extrude twice. Now that you have the fingers blocked out, go back and add in edgeloops along the length of all of your fingers.

image60.png

With some minimal adjustment of verts, we have a hand!

Now let’s finish off some details in the face.

image61.png

Extrude the mouth in a couple of times to get a nice cavity.

image62.png

Grab these faces and extrude in to get your nostrils.


image63.png

Finally, extrude the eyes for some eye sockets.
 
image64.png

image65.png

Alright you now have a water-tight base mesh for your human character. Now, your character is probably pretty misshapen right now (so is mine), but you now have the proper topology to sculpt your character. You can now use your sculpt tools on your mesh to push stuff around until it fits your character sheets.

image66.png

With a ton of sculpting your model can end up looking like this! Please note the topology on the model: keep in mind that you should have at least 3 edge loops at the joint area, and less concentrated edge loops where there are no joints. This is <b>SUPER</b> important for rigging and skinning, where one edge loop should NOT dictate your rig.

Please submit a less rough version of your model to the homework form. We will NOT accept any misshapen human models, so please be sure to look up anatomy references or use your own character sheets as guides!

HEADING LARGE: CLOTHING & ACCESSORIES (Optional)

At this point we have a mostly finished model with great topology and edge flow as well as the details we want in our character. The last step for us to have a complete model is to give our character some clothing and accessories. 

<b>THIS PART OF THE LAB IS OPTIONAL</b> especially if you are not using the character you created for your short films. However if you do plan on using your character for your shorts, then I highly recommend you look through this section as a guide (unless you plan on having a naked and/or bald character o.0)

HEADING MEDIUM: Clothing

We’re going to start with sculpting on some clothes for April. I find that the easiest way to create clothes that ensures that they will easily fit your character and have better topology is to make the clothes directly from the body of the character. What that means is that I will be duplicating April’s mesh and keeping only the faces that I need for each specific item.

Let’s start with her shirt.

First, I’m going to duplicate April’s body mesh (remember that your objects should be NAMED IN YOUR OUTLINER). Then I’m going to delete the faces that I don’t want to be a part of her shirt mesh. I’m going to start with the arms.

Accessories/1_shirt.png

Accessories/2_shirt.png

Then I’m going to delete the faces for her head and legs.

Accessories/3_shirt.png

Now that I have the basic shape that I want for the shirt, I’m going to use the sculpting tools to get the specific details to match my character sheets.

Accessories/6_shirt.png

With this, I have the look that I want for the shirt. I’m going to extrude the mesh of the shirt outwards so that we don’t see the reverse side of the normals.

Accessories/7_shirt.png

Now I’m going to adjust the shape of the sleeves a bit to give it more volume.

Accessories/10_shirt.png

We are going to repeat the same process for the pants (keep in mind that the process we laid out earlier can be done with almost any clothing item).

Duplicate the body mesh again and delete the extraneous faces.

Accessories/13_pant.png

Sculpt and shape the clothing item how you see fit and then extrude outwards.

Accessories/14_pant.png

Now you can fit the clothing item onto your character. Make sure that the body mesh does not stick out of the clothes (if it does, make sure you go back and sculpt more on the clothes)

Accessories/15_pant.png

Before you move on, make sure you name everything in your outliner.

HEADING MEDIUM: Hair

There are many many different ways to handle hair for a character in 3D animation, however for the sake of our class, most students simply sculpt on hair for their character so that’s what we’ll do here.

If you are interested in experimenting with different styles of hair, feel free to look into programs like XGen (if you have the time).

We are going to repeat the same process as earlier (i.e. duplicate the mesh, delete extraneous faces, and sculpt).

First, I’m going to duplicate April’s mesh one more time and delete all of the other faces except for the top section.

Accessories/16_hair.png

At this point, this mesh might look something like a helmet on top of your character.

Accessories/17_hair.png

Now I’m going to select the bottom ring of faces and extrude them downwards.

 Keep in mind the steps I am doing might be more specific to my character’s hair so feel free to branch off and do what you need for your character.

Accessories/19_hair.png

Now I’m going to add some more edge loops in the back to get more flexibility for sculpting.

Accessories/20_hair.png

At this point, I spent a lot of time sculpting the hair to get the shape that I wanted. One tool that I found extremely helpful was the inflate tool in the sculpting tools shelf. This gave the hair some weight to it. 

This is where you need to utilize your own creative decisions and skills to get what you want for your character.

For now, I am satisfied with this for the hair:

Accessories/21_hair.png

At long last, we have our completed character with great topology and great details.

Congrats on finishing the lab!! We know that it was a long one but we hope that you learned a lot about organic modeling in the process. Once again, feel free to spend as much time as you want to get your character to look the way you want. Make sure your outliner is clean and organized before you submit!
