HEADING LARGE: USING RENDERMAN ON THE LAB MACHINES

HEADING MEDIUM: SETTING UP THE ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
This is one annoying step that will have to be done before you can use the RenderMan for Maya plugin on the lab machines. The good news is once you do this once you won't have to do it again for the rest of the semester.

1. Open up Finder, and hit Command-Shift-G. In the dialog that pops up, type '~/Library/Preferences/Autodesk/maya/2016' (if you are using a fresh account, this folder will not be created until you launch Maya for the first time). You will see a file called 'Maya.env'.

2. Open the file in a text editor that has line numbers (Sublime Text 2 is a good choice) and add the following lines:
"
RMSTREE=/Applications/Pixar/RenderManStudio-20.3-maya2016
RMANTREE=$RMSTREE/rmantree 
MAYA_MODULE_PATH=$RMSTREE/etc 
MAYA_PLUG_IN_PATH=$RMSTREE/plug-ins
MAYA_SCRIPT_PATH=$RMSTREE/scripts 
PYTHONPATH=$RMSTREE/scripts:$RMANTREE/bin:$PYTHONPATH 
PATH=$RMANTREE/bin:$RMSTREE/bin:$PATH
"
Save the file when you are done.

3. Open up Maya and click Windows --> Settings and Preferences --> Plug-in Manager. At the top of the window you should notice there's a new entry called RenderMan_for_Maya.bundle. Click 'Loaded' and it should load into Maya (possibly with an error or two, probably nothing too worrisome). You should also click 'Auto load' and then go to File --> Save Preferences so you don't have to do this again! Maya will now load the RenderMan plugin every time you start it up.

HEADING MEDIUM: GETTING MORE SPACE
This may seem like an optional or annoying step, but it really isn't. By default, the the EECS instructional accounts do not have a much free storage space. The space that they do have will be eaten up quickly because Renderman will create a bunch of extra files every single time you click 'render'. In particular, it will generate .rib files for every frame of your scene, .tex files for every image texture, and .exr files for every rendered image you save.

Long story short, this is how you get about 20 GB of scratch space on your account. This is generally still not enough to carry out entire jobs, so copy out frames as they're rendering and delete them when they're copied AS THE JOB IS GOING! It's still a lot better than the local CC folder though.
Open up terminal. Enter the command 'ssh [your account]@cory.eecs.berkeley.edu'. Enter your password to log into the server.
Now from cory, run the command '/share/b/bin/mkhometmpdir'. You can now close terminal.
There is now a folder on all the lab computers where you have unlimited storage. To access it, open up finder, hit command-shift-G, and go to '/home/tmp/[your account]'.
Move your entire Maya Project folder here, and set the project to this new directory using File --> Set Project.

HEADING LARGE: RENDERING USING TRACTOR
To keep Tractor well organized, we ask that you name the scene as follows. This way you can easily see which scene is rendering on the Tractor screen.
GROUPNAME - SCENE X OF TOTAL - DESCRIPTION
ie: BANDITS - SCENE 8 of 21 - BREAKING VASE

Once you have done some test renders on the computer that you are using, you have figured out your optimal settings, and you want to push out some final frames for your animation, you are ready to use the fully operational power of the mac lab (hopefully, fingers crossed). If you need to speed up your render and separate the shadows (ask your facilitator if this is the case) read RENDERING SHADOWS SEPARATELY first before you submit your render to Tractor.

Double check to make sure your rendering settings are configured correctly, then go to the Renderman --> Batch Render [option box]. In the dialog that pops up, make sure the appropriate options are selected:

You can watch the progress of your render job in realtime at http://york.cs.berkeley.edu/tv/. Simply enter your username, no password needed. Your files should be saved out in the /renderman/ folder within your project. There may be multiple subfolders within this one, sort them by 'Date modified' and you should be able to find the folder than Renderman most recently generated.

HEADING LARGE: RENDERING SHADOWS SEPARATELY
Note that you should only do this if your render is really slow. Also, this works best if the camera is still.

Before you start, render the background without visibility of anything that moves (put all characters/moving objects in separate layer) and render ONE frame of this. Do not send this one frame to tractor. It should render fine on the mac you are using or your laptop by itself.

1. Select object you want shadows on
2. Click the holdout button in the renderman tab
3. Make sure only "shadows" is checked
4. Batch render (see previous section)
5. Composite the _filtered image on top of the background image using whatever program you wish. We support After Effects in this class, so see the Compositing Lab for help with this.
-Note: If you did not check "denoise" in the render settings, you might only get a regular image (not _filtered)

Now you should be ready for and and all post production. Good job, you're almost done with your shorts!
