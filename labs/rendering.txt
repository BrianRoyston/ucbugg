HEADING LARGE: BATCH RENDER SETTINGS

Batch rendering is a great option that allows you to render scenes on your local machine rather than sending them off onto a Render Farm. Keep in mind that batch rendering will take longer than most other forms of rendering so it's a good idea to render smaller or less complex scenes locally (we usually recommend scenes around or less than 70 frames). More complex or longer scenes can be saved for Cloud Rendering which is discussed later in this lab.

Here is a quick breakdown on the different render settings that are important to remember before you send off your jobs. 

Go to <b> RenderMan -> Render Settings</b>. 

renderSettings.png

If you don't see the Renderman tab, it's because the Renderman plugin is disabled. Make sure to go to the plug-in manager, and enable the Renderman plugin if it is not already enabled.

HEADING MEDIUM: COMMON SETTINGS

After opening the <b> Render Settings </b> tab you should see a gray window like this:

commonSettings.png

These are your general or common render settings that apply to all renderers that you use. Pay attention to the areas outlined in red:

<li> 1. First, you want to make sure that <b> Render Using </b> is set to <b> Renderman </b>.</li> 
<li> 2. Next, make sure that you are in the <b> Common Tab </b> towards the top left. </li>
<li> 3. Go to the FRAME RANGE section and change the settings to <b> Animation </b> if you want to render more than one frame. Then set the correct frame range of your scene. You can leave the other frame range settings as they were. </li>
<li> 4. Go to the RENDERABLE CAMERAS section. Make sure you have the correct camera you want to render in renderable cameras. If you see multiple cameras in that section you should click the little trash button for each camera you <b>do not want to render</b>. </li>
<li> 5. Finally, go to the IMAGE SIZE section. If you are rendering for your final short, make sure your image size is set to HD 1080. If you are not rendering your final short, you can use HD720 or HD540 to submit some tests. </li>

HEADING MEDIUM: RENDERMAN SETTINGS

Now that we've set your common render settings, let's go into the <b> Renderman tab </b> on the top left and adjust some settings specific to Renderman.

HEADING MEDIUM: SAMPLING

Once you've clicked on the Renderman tab you should see a tab below that called <b> Sampling </b>.

sampling.png

Once again take note of all the settings highlighted in red:

For sampling, we recommend students sample at a range between 16-32. Submit some test renders to figure out what the best sampling rate for your short is. Start at 16 samples, then go up by a factor of 2 (so 32, 64, 128 etc) until you render out something that looks like good enough quality.

DO NOT exceed 32 samples unless you are given permission by a facilitator to do so. Increasing your sample size will significantly increase your render time so don't go overboard with your samples.

NOTE: Make sure you are changing your samples under the first section of the sampling tab and NOT under the IPR Samples section. Your IPR Sampling Rate will not have any effect on your final batch renders.

Lastly, we want to make sure that we are using <b> PxrPathTracer </b> under the INTEGRATOR tab. Unless you are doing stylistic rendering of some kind, you will most likely never have to change this setting.

HEADING MEDIUM: DENOISING

Next go to the <b> AOVs </b> tab. It should look like this:

denoise_NEW.png

On the right you'll see a section titled Displays. Make sure your settings match mine in the above image: mainly, you want to make sure that you have a <b> Beauty </b> tab, and a <b> Ci</b>, <b> a </b> tab below it. These are all important for your final images to come out correctly.

Below that in the DENOISE TAB, you'll see a <b> Denoise </b> option. By default, your renders won't have this option selected. Denoising is an important tool to help your renders come out without background render noise (as we discussed in lecture). 

However, in the latest versions of Renderman there is a bug that is important to keep in mind: if your computer graphics card is not powerful enough for Renderman, sometimes the Denoise option will result in your final image coming out completely black. If this does happen to you, you'll have to come back here and uncheck the Denoise option and adjust your Sampling Rate if necessary to get out excess noise. 

 
Note that if you have denoising turned on, you will have two frames rendered out. One of the images will have "_filtered" appended to the end of the file name, and that will be the denoised image. 

HEADING MEDIUM: WORKSPACE

The last important area to check is the <b> Workspace </b> tab.

workspace.png

In this tab we only need to check the <b> Image Output Directory and RIB Output Directory </b> settings. The image output directory is essentially the place where your final renders will be sent, and the RIB output directory is where Renderman will set up the RIB data that it needs to start rendering your images. By default, they are set to the <b> Images </b> and <b> Renderman </b> folder of your project window. 

It is fine to keep them there, however, sometimes it becomes easy to lose track of your renders if they get placed in your project folder. Additionally, renders are HEAVY files, and it might be best to not crowd your project space with renders but rather keep them in a separate place. I personally like to create a folder on my desktop for my local renders and that is where I redirect both my Image Output as well as my RIB Output. That way its easy to keep track of and I can easily put them on a hard drive for my teammates to access. 

If you do decide to change your file outputs make sure you change BOTH the Image and RIB Outputs to <b> THE SAME PLACE </b>. It should look something like this:

newOutputLocation.png

It is important to remember that both of these filepaths <b> SHOULD NOT HAVE ANY SPACES, PERIODS, OR SPECIAL CHARACTERS </b> in them otherwise your job will most likely error.

HEADING MEDIUM: SENDING OFF YOUR BATCH RENDER

Once you've checked all of these settings you are ready to send off your Batch Render. Simply go to <b> Renderman -> Batch Render </b>.

batchRender.png

Maya will scroll through your animation in the timeline in order to generate the RIB files needed for rendering. Once they are done generating, another window like this should open up.

batchRender_WINDOW.png

This window allows you to monitor the status of your jobs, including the progress of individual frames. 

You are now ready to Batch Render!

HEADING LARGE: RENDERING USING TRACTOR

HEADING MEDIUM: SETTING UP TRACTOR ON THE LAB MACHINES

Using Tractor on the lab machines causes some security issues for the department. So, in order to use Tractor, there are a couple steps you need to do first so that everyone can use the render farm without any security issues. 

<b>NOTE:</b> These steps require you to use the terminal. I will try to lay them out as clearly as I can but please do not hesitate to ask a facilitator for help. Don't worry about how many steps there are, this should only take a couple of minutes. 

<b>STEP 1:</b> Quit Maya. You cannot have any instances of Maya open while you set up. 

<b>STEP 2:</b> Create a tmp directory for your account. To create your own  tmp directory, please login to
        http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/webacct, click on the
        'Account Details' or 'More' buttons, and then on
        'Make /home/tmp Directory' on the next page.

<b>STEP 3:</b> Open the terminal on the linux machines (Applications->System Tools->MATE Terminal). Type: <br>
<b>chmod 755 /home/tmp/YOUR_ACCOUNT</b> <br><br>
then press enter

<b>STEP 4:</b> Go to your newly created directory by typing:
<br> <b>cd /home/tmp/YOUR_ACCOUNT</b> 

<b>STEP 5:</b> Create a new directory for tractor by typing:<br> 
<b>mkdir tractor</b><br><br>
 then pressing enter. 

At this point, we have created a folder tractor to host our Maya project folder. Now we need to ensure tractor will have permissions to write, read and edit files here. 

<b>STEP 6:</b> Type:<br>
<b>chmod 777 tractor</b><br><br>
then press enter. 

<b>STEP 7:</b> Copy your project files to the tractor directory. To access this directory from Finder, open up Finder, press CMD + SHIFT + G and type: <br>
<b>/home/tmp/YOUR_ACCOUNT</b> <br><br>
Make sure your project has it's own folder within tractor.

<b>STEP 8:</b> Once your files have been transfered, go back to the terminal. If you have not quit out of the terminal and the terminal is still where it was during step 6, type 'cd tractor'. If you have quit out of the terminal, type 'cd home/tmp/YOUR_ACCOUNT/tractor'

<b>STEP 9:</b> More permission commands, type each of the following commands in seperately. <br>
<li> <b>find . -type d -exec chmod 777 {} \;</b> </li>
<li> <b>find . -type f -exec chmod 666 {} \;</b> </li>

<b>STEP 10:</b> Type:<br>
<b>umask 000</b><br><br>
then press enter. NOT UNMASK, BUT "UMASK". This part is especially important so your renders don't fail in preflight. 

<b>STEP 11:</b> Now you can reopen Maya. However, <b>you must open it via the terminal</b> in order for the permission settings we've changed above to work. This is why it was important to not have any Maya instances open before. To open Maya via the terminal, type "/Applications/Autodesk/maya2017/Maya.app/Contents/bin/maya" then press enter. 

There you go! Tractor should now be working. Submit a test job of 5 frames to be sure. 

NOTE: If you close the terminal, you lose the permisson settings (umask) that you just set. So, if you ever close the terminal but need to submit another job, you need to "cd /home/tmp/YOUR_ACCOUNT/tractor" then repeat steps 10 and 11 again. 

HEADING MEDIUM: SUBMITTING A JOB TO TRACTOR

Reminder that you must open up Maya via the terminal as described in the section above for Tractor to work. If you do not, your job will fail at pre-flight.

To keep Tractor well organized, we ask that you name the scene as follows. This way you can easily see which scene is rendering on the Tractor screen.
GROUPNAME - SCENE X OF TOTAL - DESCRIPTION
ie: BANDITS - SCENE 8 of 21 - BREAKING VASE

Once you have done some test renders on the computer that you are using, you have figured out your optimal settings, and you want to push out some final frames for your animation, you are ready to use the fully operational power of the mac lab (hopefully, fingers crossed). If you need to speed up your render and separate the shadows (ask your facilitator if this is the case) read RENDERING SHADOWS SEPARATELY first before you submit your render to Tractor.

Make sure to set your projects to the correct folder (File >> Set Project). Double check to make sure your rendering settings are configured correctly. Go to Renderman Globals (first button on the Renderman bar) and change the settings accordingly. Remember, you should output .EXR images at HD720 with sampling at some value between 16-32. 

Now you can start batch rendering. Go to the Renderman --> Batch Render [option box]. In the dialog that pops up, make sure the appropriate options are selected:
Screen Shot 2015-12-01 at 4.25.10 PM.png

You can watch the progress of your render job in realtime at http://rayban.cs.berkeley.edu/tv/. Simply enter your username, no password needed. Your files should be saved out in the /renderman/ folder within your project. There may be multiple subfolders within this one, sort them by 'Date modified' and you should be able to find the folder than Renderman most recently generated.

HEADING LARGE: RENDERING USING GOOGLE CLOUD

HEADING MEDIUM: SETTING UP GOOGLE CLOUD

If you want/need more rendering power, you can use Zync Render, which is on Google Cloud. This is a more convenient option over tractor, but there are many issues that may also come with this. 

HEADING SMALL: SETTING UP A ZYNC ACCOUNT THROUGH THE SCHOOL

<b>IMPORTANT!! Once you have your render settings set up, PLEASE CALL OVER A FACILITATOR to make sure that everything looks correct to check you off. They will ask you for your @berkeley.edu e-mail to give you access to the Zync render farm. Otherwise, you will not be able to log in and continue following the steps.</b>

<b>STEP 1:</b> Download the Zync client app and the Zync plugin from <a href='https://www.zyncrender.com/downloads/'>here</a>

<b>STEP 2:</b> Start the Zync client app. Click on “Connection Settings” and under Zync Site Address, enter <i>https://instzync1.zync.io</i>. Click “Login With Google” and sign in with your Calnet account (your @berkeley.edu account). This should take you to a page where you need to authorize Zync to access a few things. Afterwards, your window should look like this:

zyncIN.png

<b>STEP 3:</b> Start Maya. If Maya was already opened when you were downloading the client and plugin, please restart the program.

HEADING MEDIUM: SUBMITTING A JOB TO GOOGLE CLOUD

Note: Make sure you don't have any whitespaces in your path. If you do, the render will fail. Name your scenes by the following convention:
<b>GROUPNAME_SCENE#OF#_DESCRIPTION</b>, i.e. “THEONLYSTAR_SCENE2OF17_LOOKINGATSKY” instead of “THE ONLY STAR - SCENE 2 OF 17 - LOOKING AT SKY”

<b>STEP 1:</b> Open up the Zync client app. Open up the file you would like to render. Make sure all of your render settings are correct (You can edit these under RenderMan >> Advanced RenderMan Controls). Under the Zync tab in your menu bar in Maya, click on the Zync logo. In both the client app and the Zync Submit window, make sure to log in to your google account that you previously registered with. 
zync1.png

<b>STEP 2: </b> There are a variety of settings you can play around with in the Zync Submit window. Below, I will list the settings that I have changed from default or I think are important to note. 
zync2.png
	<li> a. <b>Num. Machines</b> refers to the number of computers you will have rendering at the same time. You can put any number you like here, but 50 is the max you can use at once. </li>
	<li> b. <b>Machine Type</b> is the kind of computer you will use. In the screenshot above, I have it set to the cheapest option, which is the PREEMPTIBLE 16GB one. </li>
	<li> c. Make sure you check <b>“Ignore Missing Plugin Errors”</b>. Maya has some weird problems sometimes so this will help us avoid those. </li>
	<li> d. <b>Project folder</b> and <b>output directory</b> show where it is taking all the files from as well as where it will send the renders. Make sure that there is no whitespace in either of these, otherwise your render might fail. Don't just change the name in this line though. You have to actually change the file path. </li>
	<li> e. <b>Renderer</b> should be set to Renderman. </li>
	<li> f. <b>Frame range</b> should carry over from your render settings but it's still good to double check that you are rendering the correct frames. </li>
	<li> g. <b>Chunk size</b> refers to how many frames Zync will give one machine. You should set this to 1 to get more done in less time. </li>
	<li> h. If you have more render layers than default, select them here. Otherwise, just select <b>“defaultRenderLayer”</b>. </li>
	<li> i. Your <b>resolution</b> should also carry through from your render settings. For your final short, you should be rendering in 1920x1080 (Full HD) but other resolutions are fine for testing purposes. </li>

<b><i>IMPORTANT! IF THIS IS YOUR FIRST TIME SUBMITTING A JOB, PLEASE CALL OVER A FACILITATOR TO CHECK OVER YOUR RENDER SETTINGS BEFORE YOU CONTINUE!!</b></i>

<b> STEP 3: </b> Hit "Launch Job". Go to <a href='https://instzync1.zync.io'>https://instzync1.zync.io</a> to watch the progress of your renders. They should auto-download once they're done but you shouldn't turn off your computer while it is going, otherwise the files might not get downloaded.  

HEADING SMALL: SETTING UP YOUR OWN ZYNC RENDERING ACCOUNT

<b><i>Note: Only set this up if you are in desperate need for more renders. Otherwise, the school accounts and tractor should be enough to render your short.</b></i>
Please make sure to follow these instructions in the order they are given. Zync is still in beta and if you do this out of order, your project may not get set up correctly and you won't be able to render. 

<b>STEP 1: </b> Go to <a href='https://console.cloud.google.com'> Google Cloud Console </a>. There should be a button on the top right that says "Sign up for free trial" and follow the next instructions. At some point in this registration, it'll ask for your credit card. Don't worry, google cloud isn't like all those other websites that require credit cards and it won't charge you when your trial is over. 

<b>STEP 2: </b> Now go to <a href='https://zyncrender.com'> Zync's website </a> and click register. Create a website (you can name it anything you want) and put in whatever you like for "Your Company Name". Click Next, and then wait for the email confirming your registration. 

<b>STEP 3: </b> Next, click on "Downloads" (or alternatively, <a href ='https://www.zyncrender.com/downloads/'>click here</a>). Download both the client app and the plugin for your OS. Follow the installation instructions for both. 

<b>STEP 4: </b> Open up the client app. Now go to your zync website and login. If you don't have any red bars going across the bottom, you are all set. If you do, click on the bar and follow the instructions to solve the problem. 

HEADING LARGE: RENDERING SHADOWS SEPARATELY
Note that you should only do this if your render is really slow. Also, this works best if the camera is still.

Before you start, render the background without visibility of anything that moves (put all characters/moving objects in separate layer) and render ONE frame of this. Do not send this one frame to tractor. It should render fine on the mac you are using or your laptop by itself.

1. Select object you want shadows on
2. Click the holdout button in the renderman tab
3. Make sure only "shadows" is checked
4. Batch render (see previous section)
5. Composite the _filtered image on top of the background image using whatever program you wish. We support After Effects in this class, so see the Compositing Lab for help with this.
-Note: If you did not check "denoise" in the render settings, you might only get a regular image (not _filtered)

Now you should be ready for and and all post production. Good job, you're almost done with your shorts!
