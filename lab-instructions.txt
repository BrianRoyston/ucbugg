sorry, this sounds complicated because I am lazy and javascript sucks. It's pretty simple, just don't mess up

LAB INSTRUCTIONS: 
	NAMING:
		1) make a file called labname.txt inside the LABS folder
		2) "labname" must be a FULLY LOWERCASE EXACT MATCH of the UPPERCASE LAB NAME in the pipeline gui
			For example, basic modeling.txt, advanced rigging 2.txt, lighting.txt
		3) If you want to create a NEW lab, follow the same procedure, and also ADD THE NAME to labs.js in the website scripts folder if its not already there

	FILES AND IMAGES
		make a folder called "labname" inside the LABS folder, and put all images and files in there

	LAB.TXT FORMATTING
		Don't include a title (it will be auto-generated)

		Don't forget to check labs.js to make sure your lab is included

		to make a heading, use either
			HEADING LARGE:
			HEADING MEDIUM:
			HEADING SMALL:

		to insert an image, put the file name on its own line. line must end with .png, .jpg, or .gif
			(make sure the image is in the folder with the same name as the lab file name)

		to insert a non-image file (like a .ma file), do FILE: filename.

		to bold text, surround it with <b> </b> like this:
			I hope you remembered to <b> freeze transformations!!! </b>

		to italicize text, use <i> </i>

		to highlight text, use <mark> </mark>

		to strikethrough text, use <del> </del>
		
		to create a hyperlink, use <a href="linknamehere">Your Text</a>

		feel free to check out other HTML tags that work/are useful and add to this list :)
